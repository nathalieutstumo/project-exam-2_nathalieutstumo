## Contributing

The project is utilising next.js and global styling in a global.css file. The folder structure is simple with all pages in a folder with the same name, that can be found in the root of the project, and contains folders for each page on the site. All the page folders contain an index.js file where the main code for that page is found. In the pages/details folder there is also a [ id ].js file which is used to fetch the idâ€™s from the api. The pages/api folder contains login.js and logout.js which is used for logging in and out from the admin section.

There is an img folder in the root with the images that are used in the boxes on the homepage and the logo.

In the root of the project you will also find a components folder which contains folders that are pretty self-explanatory. The api is down so if you want the code that passes the api information to work you will have to use another api and change the code accordingly so you get the information.
